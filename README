Bracket Handicapper
-------------------

Given an office's bracket pool and FiveThirtyEight's NCAAM team
ratings, run a Monte Carlo simulation to guage how often each office
pool player will win.

Preparation
-----------

1) Download https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/march-madness-api/2021/fivethirtyeight_ncaa_forecasts.csv
2) Create brackets.csv (Format should be self-explanatory. Keep the first two columns as-is.)
3) Edit bracket-handicapper.py line 165 to use the latest date from the 538 CSV

Example
-------

$ ./bracket-handicapper.py
[... many lines of output ...]
   John: 5 - 1 (16.7%)
   Dawn: 5 - 1 (15.8%)
 Rajeev: 7 - 1 (12.5%)
    Max: 7 - 1 (12.2%)
   Matt: 8 - 1 (11.3%)
   Kyle: 8 - 1 (11.2%)
   Mike: 16 - 1 (5.9%)
   Doug: 16 - 1 (5.8%)
  Brian: 30 - 1 (3.2%)
   Eric: 39 - 1 (2.5%)
   Mark: 56 - 1 (1.8%)
  Steve: 142 - 1 (0.7%)
  Peter: 434 - 1 (0.2%)
  Dusty: 1999 - 1 (0.1%)
  Danny: 1999 - 1 (0.1%)
   Adam: 9999 - 1 (0.0%)

The output is one line for each player, the fair odds of their bracket winning, and the win probability.
